# Lets-get-started

My first test GitHub repository

I always arrive late at the office, but I make up for it by leaving early ;)

I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours :)

Work is the greatest thing in the world. So we should always save some of it for tomorrow :)

I'm going to Slovakia at the weekend, and I'm going to spend my vacation in Croatia in a week as well.

But I'd love to visit Spain one day...
